# Gods of the realm
Occasionally, a being descends into the world of Samzarim as a shooting star - *a Starborn*. These beings hold great power and are generally sought by cultures for worship or for other means. The most notorious example of a Starborn is Ataneq - who helped the regular folk stop the *Godskulls* in the *Forbidden Summoning* and defeated *Nero* who tried to destroy the realm.

Being *Starborn* is not synonymous with being *Enlightened*. While most *Enlightened* are currently also *Starborn*, this is generally due to the long-lived nature of the *Starborn*.

*Starborn* typically posses some terrible innate power. For this reason they were harvested by the *Godskulls*, who extracted their powers in their effort to create a *transcendental being*.

Cultures form around *Starborn*. An example of a theocracy based around a *Starborn* are the *Noori* who take *Yuri* as their Emperor. The entire *Noori* culture is based around the *Starborn* under the name *Yuri of the Secrets*, they worship secrets, travel the world and collect knowledge. An example of a culture based around a *Starborn* contrary to the *Starborn* wishes are the *Kingdom of Man*, a necrocracy ruled by the dead descendants of *Ataneq*.

## Starcages

### Ataneq, the Traveller
One of the first and currently the oldest living *Starborn* in the realm. Ataneq came before the *Godskull* collapse. *Ataneq* is the traveller, often appearing in ragged clothes adorned with divine symbols. Despite looking like an the incarnation of fallen glory, he carries an aura of nobility and commands respect by his pure presence - despite his unknown identity.

#### Motivation
*Ataneq* is searching for a cure for a illness he and his lover possess. His lover, *Ardentia* "Brightstar" (Světřenka), is currently locked in a *Starcage* to suspend her remaining lifespan. Ataneq can often be met high in the realm, closer to the stars these days.

#### Powers
*Ataneq* commands the strength of a dark matter - he warps reality using gravity. When he activates his power, the subjects around him experience an event horizon - seeing visions of the future. His head turns into a miniature black hole during this time. The gravity also drains the lifespan of any *anima* around him.

### Julia, the Crimson
*Julia* the Crimson is the *vampire* ruler of the *Balzac* society and *Mortimere*'s twin sister. Julia experienced the horrors of *Godskulls*. She despises *Mortimere* with a burning passion for his involvement with their kind. She is much younger than *Mortimere*.

#### Motivation
*Julia* is trying to cement her place in the world. Build power in order to be safe and uncoquerable. She grew up in the blood vats of *Godskull* extractor factories. She only enslaves the dead.

#### Power
*Julia* is one of the progenitor vampires.

## Mortimere of the Dead
*Mortimere* is the unwilling king of the dead. He is also known as the Collector for his depraved pastime. 

## Tonkar, the Hero of people

## Nero, the Conqueror

## Yuri of the Secrets
